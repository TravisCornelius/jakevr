Dungeon Levers
Lylek Games

Thank you for purchasing this asset!

Scripts and prefabs are already included for easy use. Demo scene provided.

ACTIVATION-SCRIPT:
To activate objects using the levers, use the activation script.

You can find the ActivationScript in the Scripts folder. Apply this script to your Main Camera.
This script is responsible for activating objects. In game, look at the object to be activated
and press the Left-Mouse-Button. An ActivationSctiptTop is also included for top-down view
games. Simply click on the object itself, instead of looking at it.

All levers (or any object) you wish to activate must be taged as "Interact" or the ActivationScript
will not notice them. Then assign a script to the lever (or object) to be ran. This script must
include a function called Activate(). Activate() will be called on all scripts attached to the lever.

We have included some example scripts for you, in the Assets>DungeonLevers>Scripts>MiscScripts folder.

If you need any help, please contact support@lylekgames.com, and/or leave a review.
Thank you!
